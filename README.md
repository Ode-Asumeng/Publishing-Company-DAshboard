# Publishing-Company-DAshboard
This Dashboard was done on a publishing company to see their progress over a couple of years.
This Dashboard was created to show the growth of a publishing company over the years 2017,2018,2019,2020,2021. 
From the dashboard we realised that the publishing company gave projects in groups and individually. 
The output of the individual people was much higher than the groups. 
The recommendation given was that they should place the high performers in groups with low performers. This would help  improve the output of the company.
